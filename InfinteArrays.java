/*Given an array "A" of N integers and you have also defined the new array "B" as a
concatenation of array "A" for an infinite number of times.
For example, if the given array "A" is [1,2,3] then, infinite array "B" is
Now you are given Q queries, each query consists of two integers "L" and "R"(l-
based indexing). Your task is to find the sum of the subarray from index "L" to "R"
(both inclusive) in the infinite array "B" for each query.*/
